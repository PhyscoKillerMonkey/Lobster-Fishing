#Lobster Fishing

Lobster fishing is a simple browser game of luck. The aim is to gain as much money as possible by catching lobsters in your pots. As the game progresses you can buy more pots to catch more lobsters but beware, any pots left off-shore during a stormy day will be swept away leaving you with no lobsters and fewer pots.
